# Spaceman Game

Here is the link to my game: https://jamesc215.github.io/Spaceman-Game/
## ****Breakdown of the game and what it does:****

-Word guessing game - name was changed to Spaceman instead of Hangman to divert away from the negative connotations of “Hang”-man.

-Generate a random string of hidden letters from a list of categories the player has to choose from.

-Players have to choose letters from the alphabet to guess the word.

-Hidden letters until a letter is guessed, then reveal each letter if/when they are guessed.

-Once the correct answer is guessed, the game will end!


## ****Potential/Icebox features:****

-Adding space themed sounds each time a button is pressed.

-Adding warp-style buttons when hovered over.

-Adding images to create a more space style theme.

-Adding a spaceship that builds piece by piece each time a player loses a life.


## ****Plan to tackle the problem****

-Start with basic HTML, linking both the JavaScript and CSS files to the index.html page.

-Correctly try and create everything needed from the Wireframe workbook/screenshot e.g headers, footers, paragraphs, divs etc.

-Format the CSS to create a rough copy of the Wireframe, so that it is visual and to make it easier to link through Javascript.

-Tackle in small bites/sections, e.g making a button work by adding an eventListener etc.

-In Javascript, breakdown sections: 
*/----constants----*/
*/----cached elements----*/
*/----variables----*/
*/----event listeners----*/
*/----functions----*/
