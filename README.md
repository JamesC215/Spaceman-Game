# Spaceman Game

Here is the link to my game: https://jamesc215.github.io/Spaceman-Game/
## User requirements:

- A computer/phone with access to the internet.
- The link above.
- That's it!

## ****Breakdown of the game and what it does:****

-Word guessing game - name was changed to Spaceman instead of Hangman to divert away from the negative connotations of “Hang”-man.

-Generate a random string of hidden letters from a list of categories the player has to choose from.

-Players have to choose letters from the alphabet to guess the word.

-Hidden letters until a letter is guessed, then reveal each letter if/when they are guessed.

-Once the correct answer is guessed, the game will end!


## ****Potential/Icebox features:****

-Adding space themed sounds each time a button is pressed.

-Adding warp-style buttons when hovered over.

-Adding images to create a more space style theme.

-Adding a spaceship that builds piece by piece each time a player loses a life.


## ****Plan to tackle the problem****

-Start with basic HTML, linking both the JavaScript and CSS files to the index.html page.

-Correctly try and create everything needed from the Wireframe workbook/screenshot e.g headers, footers, paragraphs, divs etc.

-Format the CSS to create a rough copy of the Wireframe, so that it is visual and to make it easier to link through Javascript.

-Tackle in small bites/sections, e.g making a button work by adding an eventListener etc.

-In Javascript, breakdown sections: 
*/----constants----*/
*/----cached elements----*/
*/----variables----*/
*/----event listeners----*/
*/----functions----*/

## Wireframe before beginning the game

<img width="1325" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-22 at 20 49 20" src="https://github.com/JamesC215/Spaceman-Game/assets/136309778/fbaf605f-59ab-409c-9c27-5cb51736d99b">

- This is my basic Wireframe before starting the game. Upon completion, I had a basic idea of what my game could potentially look like when it is finished.
- My finished game, however, looked different due to both technical issues and also changing my mind on certain ideas.

## In its early stages

See below a screenshot of an early stage of the game:

- This is my game after day 1 of the project.
- I made this through basic HTML, with a bit of CSS styling to assist me visually, and I created my alphabet and restart button through DOM Manipulation (my restart button was an empty button at this point)

## During Development

- This is my game on day 3. I hit a few speedbumps on this day, mainly with the correct rendering of the category buttons and also ensuring that my reset button worked.
- I added a lot of CSS styling on this day, keeping to a classic game browser feel with the use of a relevant "Spaceman" themed background and also with coloring etc.

## My MVP

- This is my game on the final day of the project. I fixed the restart button so that it resets the categories anytime during and after the game, and the category buttons rendered correctly.
- I am content with the game at this stage, however, I have a lot of things I would still like to add in future.

## Future Development/Icebox features
- My initial plan was to have a spaceship that builds after each life lost, but I did not have the technical skill/time to do it.
- Adding more categories/more words to each category.
- Add the hint button as an option only if the player needs it (it currently renders with the category).
- Add CSS media queries that render the game correctly on each platform it is used on.
